## auction-engine
A Go and Playwright-based automation tool that searches for the best auction deals on the Troostwijk Auctions website. Given a search term, it automatically fetches and paginates through all search results to collect detailed information about each listing. The collected data is then analyzed using an LLM to identify the most appealing deals worth focusing on.
